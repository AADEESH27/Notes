CommonJS = [module.exports, const package = require(””)].

EJS Module = [export default, import] [export, import{}].

### React.js, often referred to simply as React, is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications where the user interface needs to be dynamic and responsive.

Single entry in point index.html with div having class root.

In src index.js react.createRoot method creates a virtual dom in which the whole UI is loaded.

## React Hooks:

In order to display functional variables in react we use states and hooks provide us with a way to manage and updata these states.

### **useState** = creation and updation.

objects can be displayed using (.) operator in states so use an empty array to store objects and map over them to work with them.

Handle multiple states like posting a post we need body and title, so they can be managed under a single state inputs.

### useCallback = used for optimization of our code ex : for running a function only when needed.

### useEffect = syntax :

useEffect(() ⇒ {

}, [])

takes a callback function. used to run a command only when dependencies inside [] changes or if [] left empty only once if no [] is used then run every time when any change happens on the page.

### useRef = used to refer the entites that are not needed for rendering and any other task that does not affect the DOM eg copy to clipboard.

## Browser only understands HTML/CSS/JSS

After npm build react gets converted into HMTL, CSS and JS only.

**Any thing on the website that changes is state.**

**A state change triggers re-render**
