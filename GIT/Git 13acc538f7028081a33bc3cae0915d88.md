### If branches have been deleted from the remote repository (origin) and you want to update your local repository to reflect these changes, you can clean up your local branch list.

`git fetch --prune`

`git fetch --prune && git remote prune origin.` 

### 1. **Create Feature Branches**

- For each new feature or fix, create a new branch off of `main` (or sometimes off `stage` if the feature depends on unmerged changes).
- Naming convention can help keep things organized, e.g., `feature/some-feature-name` or `fix/bug-description`.
- Create a new branch with:
    
    ```bash
    bash
    Copy code
    git checkout -b feature/some-feature-name main
    
    ```
    

### 2. **Develop and Commit**

- Work on your feature branch, committing changes as needed.
- When you’re ready to test or share your work, push the branch to the remote:
    
    ```bash
    bash
    Copy code
    git push origin feature/some-feature-name
    
    ```
    

### 3. **Merge Feature Branches into `stage`**

- Once your feature is complete, merge it into the `stage` branch for testing and QA.
- First, switch to the `stage` branch and pull any recent changes:
    
    ```bash
    bash
    Copy code
    git checkout stage
    git pull origin stage
    
    ```
    
- Merge your feature branch:
    
    ```bash
    bash
    Copy code
    git merge feature/some-feature-name
    
    ```
    
- Push `stage` to the remote repository:
    
    ```bash
    bash
    Copy code
    git push origin stage
    
    ```
    

### 4. **Test on `stage` Branch**

- Run tests or deploy the `stage` branch to a staging environment to verify that everything works as expected.
- If there are issues, you can make additional commits to your feature branch and repeat the merge and push to `stage`.

### 5. **Merge `stage` into `main` for Production Release**

- Once the `stage` branch is confirmed to be stable, merge it into `main` for production deployment.
- Switch to `main` and pull the latest changes:
    
    ```bash
    bash
    Copy code
    git checkout main
    git pull origin main
    
    ```
    
- Merge `stage` into `main`:
    
    ```bash
    bash
    Copy code
    git merge stage
    
    ```
    
- Push the `main` branch to the remote repository:
    
    ```bash
    bash
    Copy code
    git push origin main
    
    ```
    

### 6. **Clean Up**

- After a feature is deployed, you can delete the local and remote feature branches if they’re no longer needed:
    
    ```bash
    bash
    Copy code
    git branch -d feature/some-feature-name
    git push origin --delete feature/some-feature-name
    
    ```
    

### Summary of Workflow

1. Create feature branches off `main`.
2. Work on features and push them to remote.
3. Merge features into `stage` for testing.
4. Merge `stage` into `main` for production once stable.
5. Clean up feature branches when they’re no longer needed.
- **Create** feature branches off of `main`.
- **Pull updates from `main`** if needed while developing.
- **Test on `stage`** by merging your feature branch into `stage`, but do not merge `stage` back into your feature branch.
- **Merge into `main`** for final production deployment after testing.

### To maintain a good Git history and workflow between `main`, `stage`, and `feature_branches`, consider the following steps using local terminal:

1. **Branch Strategy**:
    - **Main**: The stable production-ready branch, with only thoroughly tested code.
    - **Stage**: For pre-production testing. Merges here should be ready for QA but not live.
    - **Feature Branches**: Each new feature or fix should be developed on a separate branch from `stage` or `main`.
2. **Feature Development**:
    - Create a feature branch off `stage` (e.g., `feature/new-feature`).
    - Commit regularly with clear messages, ideally following a standard format.
3. **Rebasing and Merging**:
    - **Rebase** feature branches onto the latest `stage` regularly to keep up with changes.
    - When a feature is complete, **rebase** it on `stage` before merging to ensure a clean history.
    - Merge the feature branch into `stage` with a **fast-forward** or **squash merge** to consolidate commits.
4. **Testing and Promotion**:
    - Deploy and test `stage`. Once QA is satisfied, merge `stage` into `main`.
    - Avoid direct commits to `main` and `stage`.
5. **Pulling Updates**:
    - For team collaboration, regularly pull updates with `-rebase` on feature branches to keep them clean and up-to-date.

By following this structure, you’ll maintain a streamlined, readable history across your project’s branches.

### To maintain a good Git history and workflow between `main`, `stage`, and `feature_branches`, consider the following steps using github:

1. **Create a Feature Branch**:
    
    Make a new feature branch from `stage` (e.g., `feature/new-feature`) and develop your feature.
    
2. **Push to GitHub**:
    
    Once your feature is complete, push your feature branch to GitHub.
    
3. **Create a Pull Request**:
    
    Open a pull request (PR) from your feature branch to `stage`. This allows team members to review and discuss the code before merging.
    
4. **Merge into Stage**:
    
    After review, merge the PR into the `stage` branch on GitHub.
    
5. **Sync Local with Remote**:
    - Pull the latest `stage` branch changes to your local `stage`.
    - Switch to your feature branch and pull the latest `stage` into it as well. This step ensures your feature branch is fully up-to-date if you need to continue development or apply hotfixes.

This workflow helps keep your branches synchronized, maintains a clean history, and leverages code reviews on GitHub.

### To rebase your `feat` branch changes onto the `stage` branch:

1. **Switch to the `feat` branch** if you aren’t already on it:
    
    ```bash
    bash
    Copy code
    git checkout feat
    
    ```
    
2. **Start the rebase onto `stage`:**
    
    ```bash
    bash
    Copy code
    git rebase stage
    
    ```
    
    This will take your changes from `feat` and apply them on top of `stage`'s history.
    
3. **Resolve any conflicts** that arise during the rebase. After resolving, mark the conflicts as resolved:
    
    ```bash
    bash
    Copy code
    git add <file>
    git rebase --continue
    
    ```
    
4. Once the rebase is complete, **switch to `stage`**:
    
    ```bash
    bash
    Copy code
    git checkout stage
    
    ```
    
5. **Merge the rebased `feat` branch** into `stage`:
    
    ```bash
    bash
    Copy code
    git merge feat
    
    ```

**Steps to change the commit message if pushed**
```
git reset --soft head~
git commit -m "The message you wanted to use"
git push -f
```
