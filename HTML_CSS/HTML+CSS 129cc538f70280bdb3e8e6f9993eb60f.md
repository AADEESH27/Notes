# HTML+CSS

1. Select tag when you want user to select between options.

```html
// To selct default for select option
 <option value="" selected disabled hidden>Choose here</option>
```

1. CSS child selector: span > p selects immediate child
2. Descendent combinator: select the inside tag [ li li ] this translates to any li inside any li
3. Adjacent sibling: h1 + p 
4. General sibling: h1~p
5. background- property 
6. background-image: linear gradient
7. float, clear
8. position: static, relative-from actual, absolute-from ancestor, sticky
    1. static: Default one.
    2. relative : Same as static. But lets you add top, right, bottom, left. Makes it move relative to it's normal position
    3. absolute: Removes from the flow and positions absolute wrt to the parent. Parent has to be relative or absolute for top, right, bottom, left to work. Else it considers the main html element as the parent .
    4. fixed : Fixed to a place. Doesn't give two shits about the parent. Always considers html element as the parent. Stays there when scrolled.
    5. sticky : Relative ( when normal) + fixed ( when scrolled). The values for top, right, bottom, left become active when scrolled
9. transform: translate, rotate, scale, skew{all these properties are written in hover} and used with transition in main style declaration for element.
10. transition: properties duration time-function delay;
11. animation: same as transition read when ever use
